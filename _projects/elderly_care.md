Are you looking for opportunities to volunteer with elderly people to provide companionship and operational support within elderly care centers abroad?

IVHQ's affordable Elderly Care volunteer projects are well suited to caring and patient volunteers who are comfortable assisting with a range of duties within elderly care centers. In many of our project locations, the responsibility of caring for the elderly is often left to social services if families cannot provide adequate support to their elders, and the support of international volunteers within these centers is greatly appreciated. Volunteer work varies by location but can include recreation and stimulation, feeding, physical therapy, as well as help with cleaning and maintaining facilities.

In addition to the operational support, the friendship, cross-cultural sharing, and mental stimulation that international volunteers provide is invaluable in supporting their overall health and wellbeing of the elders.

You can choose to volunteer for durations ranging from 1 week to 24 weeks and you don't need any specific qualifications or experience to participate on an Elderly Care project. If you're a qualified or training healthcare practitioner, these projects welcome those seeking healthcare or physiotherapy volunteer opportunities abroad.
