# Location and duration

The IVHQ Thailand volunteer program is based in Chiang Rai, the northernmost province of Thailand, which is renowned for its beautiful mountain scenery and historic sites. This is where orientation and general administration is carried out by our independent local team. Volunteer placements are located near the volunteer headquarters and in the hills with local hill tribes.

Volunteer programs start on the first and third Monday of every month. Volunteers can choose to volunteer for periods ranging from 1 week to 12 weeks. The Teaching English volunteer project has a minimum duration of 2 weeks.




# Projects

## Outdoor Work
Volunteers who enjoy physical labour and the sense of achievement felt after completing a job will be well suited to our Outdoor Work project in Thailand. Previous volunteers on this project have completed a variety of jobs, including; 

- Building water tanks
- Extending water pipe systems
- Building check dams
- Building school classrooms
- Painting school classrooms
- Developing an agricultural project
- Assisting with the maintenance of a vegetable garden
- Working on developing a plantation
- Repairing roads
- Repairing the homes of elderly villagers
- Building new homes or toilets for elderly villagers

Some work is scheduled and is expected to be carried out on a regular basis and other jobs will be assigned to volunteers as they arise. It is important to note that there are three distinct seasons in Thailand (hot, rainy, cold) and sometimes outdoor work is not possible. If this is the case, volunteers can get involved in related work that can be carried out protected from the elements, such as researching methods of agricultural production, which can be applied within the local community, and presenting planned projects to villagers.

Volunteers on​ ​the Outdoor Work project will work with the hill tribes on the​ ​second and fourth weeks.


## Teaching English
In northern areas of Thailand, local people have very limited access to formal education and there is a real need for volunteers to assist in teaching, not only young children, but also adults from surrounding hill tribes and local villages. Volunteers are needed on this project throughout the year and although local schools are closed for holidays from March to May and during October, the local team runs school camps and other activities for local hill tribe children. Volunteers may work alongside other volunteers and local teachers, and will also be expected to teach classes individually. Each volunteer is required to complete a lesson plan every morning or afternoon, prior to teaching a class. As volunteers work with the support of IVHQ’s local team and placement staff, they do not need to be qualified or experienced teachers to participate. However, we encourage volunteers to come prepared by completing some relevant training. Visit our [Online TEFL course](/online-tefl-course)page to learn how to gain an internationally-recognized TEFL certification at a discounted rate.




# Orientation

Volunteers are picked up from the airport in Chiang Rai on the Monday of their program start date and spend the day resting, meeting other volunteers and staff. Volunteers also take part in a Thai cooking lesson and get involved in some light volunteer work, if they are up for the challenge. Orientation is taken by our Thailand team at the office in Chiang Rai. Orientation begins on the Tuesday morning after your chosen start date and runs for the entire day. Orientation covers everything you need to know for your volunteer program in Thailand – Introduction to Thailand, Thai Customs, Rules and Expectations, Safety, Travel Opportunities in Thailand, Introduction to your Project and Placement. The orientation will also give you a chance to meet other volunteers and swap contact details for weekend travel and socializing.




# Volunteer schedule

​A volunteer day is subject to change depending on the time of year that you are volunteering. ​A typical daily schedule​ might be as follows:

**8.00 AM** Breakfast at the volunteer accommodation

**8.30 AM** Morning meeting for all volunteers

**9.00 AM - 11.30 AM**  Volunteer work begins. Work and hours are dependent on the project and placement that each volunteer is working at. Lunch breaks vary in time depending on the working schedule, but all volunteers get an hour to eat and relax

**1.00 PM ** Volunteer work continues

**5.00 PM** Dinner at the volunteer accommodation

**6.00 PM** Volunteers have free time to spend as they wish; however, many volunteers use this time to plan lessons or do extra work for their projects




# Accommodation

Volunteers are accommodated on-site at our local team’s headquarters in Chiang Rai. Volunteers live in a communal environment with other staff and volunteers in separate male and female lodgings. The accommodation is well integrated into surrounding the environment, as the buildings are made of wood and soil. The dormitories are cool in summer and warm in winter and they are also environmentally friendly with a design that minimizes tree logging. Mattresses are provided in the form of traditional Thai mattresses, which are much thinner than Western style. While bedding is provided, volunteers are required to also bring their own sleeping bag for their homestay experience and weekends away. Windows and doors are fitted with mosquito screens. The living conditions are basic and volunteers should be prepared to have cold running water and bucket showers. Generally in the second week, all Outdoor Work volunteers are taken on a homestay experience, working on a construction (or similar) project and living with a local family. Teaching English volunteers usually have a non-working homestay experience over the first weekend. Both of these are subject to change, depending on circumstances. Living conditions in the villages are even more basic and squat toilets and cold bucket showers are the norm. During the weekends (Sunday to Monday), volunteers can stay at the headquarters; however, many volunteers choose to travel and return on Monday evening in time for work on Tuesday.




# Meals

Traditional Thai cuisine is based on appealing to the four fundamental taste senses with a balance of the following flavours: sour, sweet, salty, and bitter. Common ingredients in Thai cooking include fish sauce, shrimp paste, chilli paste, coconut milk and lime juice. Staple foods include rice, rice noodles, vegetables and herbs. Meals served at the volunteer accommodation during the weekdays are typically Thai, however Western style food is also served. During the weekends, food is not provided and volunteers purchase food at local shops and cook for themselves, or eat out in town. If you have any special dietary requirements, please let us know when you apply for the program so we can make arrangements for you.




# Reviews

"I love projects that allow you to get your hands dirty whilst also allowing you to see tangible results for your efforts so it was great to work on reinforcing the road at the villiage as well as clear the foundation for the church in the village. I really enjoyed the genuine look of approval and gratitude we got from the village chief as we left the village. Such a humbling experience to give so little, and yet receive so much gratitude - only wishing we could do more." - Jacob Donatelle (Outdoor Work Volunteer in Thailand)
